# EdgarC – A UI/UX-Driven iOS Portfolio App

This is the full source code for **EdgarC**, a fully custom iOS portfolio app designed and built using **Swift** and **Xcode**.

The app showcases my technical abilities, personal brand, and creative approach to mobile UI/UX design. It includes interactive components such as a custom calendar, real-time weather integration, interactive map views, and built-in contact functionality — all wrapped in a responsive, clean interface.
