  <h1>📱 EdgarC – Interactive iOS Portfolio App (Built with Swift & Xcode)</h1>

  <p>
    This is more than just a calendar app — it’s a dynamic, interactive iOS experience that showcases who I am as a developer, creator, and aspiring innovator. <br>
    Designed entirely in Swift using Xcode, this app serves as a <strong>live portfolio</strong> that combines clean design with real functionality.
    <br><br>

    🔑 <strong>Core Features:</strong><br><br>

    📆 <strong>Custom Year-View Calendar</strong><br>
    Elegant SwiftUI layout with responsive sizing across all iPhones — smooth performance even on older devices.
    <br><br>

    ☀️ <strong>Live Weather API Integration</strong><br>
    Pulls real-time weather data specifically for Arlington, Texas, showing both technical skill and location-based logic.
    <br><br>

    🗺️ <strong>Interactive Map</strong><br>
    Features a draggable, zoomable map with a custom Mustang icon marker. Double-tapping opens Apple Maps with directions to a pinned location — showcasing user interaction and system integration.
    <br><br>

    🔗 <strong>Direct Contact & Social Links</strong><br>
    Easily connect with me via LinkedIn, email, phone, and social media — built with professional networking in mind.
    <br><br>

    🧠 <strong>About Me & My Journey</strong><br>
    Includes a section that highlights my goals, background, and vision as a bilingual, first-generation computer science student.
    <br><br>

    🚀 <strong>Future Projects Preview</strong><br>
    Integrated placeholders for upcoming work like my <em>AI Daytrader Bot</em> and <em>Taco Shop</em> app — all managed within the calendar as scalable modules.
    <br><br>

    💡 <strong>Why It Stands Out:</strong><br>
    This app is designed not just to tell my story — but to show my capabilities through real, functioning tools. <br>
    It merges <strong>UI design, API integration, map handling,</strong> and <strong>professional branding</strong> into one polished iOS experience.
