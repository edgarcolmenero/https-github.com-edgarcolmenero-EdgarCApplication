  <h1>📱 EdgarC – Interactive iOS Portfolio App (Built with Swift & Xcode)</h1>
  <p>
This is more than just a calendar app — it’s a dynamic, interactive iOS experience that showcases who I am as a developer, creator, and aspiring innovator. Designed entirely in Swift using Xcode, this app serves as a live portfolio that combines clean design with real functionality.

🔑 Core Features:
📆 Custom Year-View Calendar
Elegant SwiftUI layout with responsive sizing across all iPhones — smooth performance even on older devices.

☀️ Live Weather API Integration
Pulls real-time weather data specifically for Arlington, Texas, showing both technical skill and location-based logic.

🗺️ Interactive Map
Features a draggable, zoomable map with a custom Mustang icon marker. Double-tapping opens Apple Maps with directions to a pinned location — showcasing user interaction and system integration.

🔗 Direct Contact & Social Links
Easily connect with me via LinkedIn, email, phone, and social media — built with professional networking in mind.

🧠 About Me & My Journey
Includes a section that highlights my goals, background, and vision as a bilingual, first-generation computer science student.

🚀 Future Projects Preview
Integrated placeholders for upcoming work like my AI Daytrader Bot and Taco Shop app — all managed within the calendar as scalable modules.

💡 Why It Stands Out:
This app is designed not just to tell my story — but to show my capabilities through real, functioning tools. It merges UI design, API integration, map handling, and professional branding into one polished iOS experience.
